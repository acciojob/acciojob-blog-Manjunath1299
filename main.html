<a href="https://acciojob.com/blog/brute-force-vs-optimization/"><p>We can say that optimization is one step further than the brute-force method of problem solving. However, that does not mean that optimization is always the best answer. In this article, we will discuss brute force, optimization, time complexity, and space complexity and compare these methods. We will also discuss how to bridge the gap between brute force and optimization. If you are a software developer and are puzzled about both of these methods, this article is for you.

We will start by explaining time complexity and space complexity, as they are the key factors in building an efficient program.</p></a>

<a href="https://acciojob.com/blog/untitled-19/"><h1>Complete Guide on FlexBox</h1></a>
<a href="https://acciojob.com/blog/untitled-19/"><p>CSS Flexbox is a layout model that allows elements within a container to be aligned and distributed within the container. It provides a convenient way to lay out items in a row or column and allows the items to be resized dynamically to fill the available space. This makes Flexbox an excellent choice for creating responsive designs.

To understand flexbox, first understand the concept of a main axis and a cross axis. The main axis is the one set by your flex-direction property, along which all flex items are laid out. If that is a row, your main axis is along the row; if that is a column, your main axis is along the column. The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis. Its direction depends on the main axis's direction.

Here are the basic steps to create a layout using Flexbox:

Create a container element and set its “display” property to "flex".
Add child elements (flex items) within the container.
Use the flex-container and flex-item’s properties to specify various features of all the items and how they are aligned or distributed within the container.</p></a>
